The focus of this work was around consolidating the UK and European platforms into a Single Global Platform, as the business looked to expand into European and Global markets. Additionally I worked on the redesign of the search ‘matrix’ and ticket selection flow for the core UK audience in line with new designs.\n\nI also worked with another small, mission team to create a new service for querying the consolidated database of 120k+ stations and locations across Europe. The requirements were high resiliency, throughput, stability and multi-lingual support. This was built on AWS infrastructure: EC2, CloudSearch, Lambda.",
